                Boards keep tasks organized and work moving forward. In a
                glance, see everything from “things to do” to “aww yeah, we did
                it!” The different stages of a task. Start as simple as To Do,
                Doing or Done—or build a workflow custom fit to your team’s
                needs. Cards represent tasks and ideas and hold all the
                information to get the job done. As you make progress, move
                cards across lists to show their status.

                As you make progress, move cards across lists to show their
                status, providing a visual representation of the journey from
                inception to completion. This dynamic process fosters
                transparency and accountability within the team, as everyone can
                easily track the status of tasks and collaborate effectively.
