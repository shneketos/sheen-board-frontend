                Backlog serves as a repository for tasks, ideas, and features
                awaiting implementation. It provides a comprehensive view of
                pending work items, allowing teams to prioritize and organize
                tasks effectively. From initial brainstorming to refined
                planning, backlog ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

                Sprints, on the other hand, are timeboxed iterations lasting
                typically one to four weeks. During sprints, teams
                collaboratively focus on delivering a set of prioritized backlog
                items. This structured approach allows for incremental progress
                and regular feedback, contributing to the overall progression of
                the project.
