            Backlog serves as a repository for tasks, ideas, and features
            awaiting implementation. It provides a comprehensive view of pending
            work items, allowing teams to prioritize and organize tasks
            effectively. From initial brainstorming to refined planning, backlog
            ensures nothing falls through the cracks.
